tymix is all about describing a UNIX machine time, in human language words.
tymix supports different levels of granularity, from vague and general to percise one (see examples below).


How to use tymix?

First, include the JS files under your application:
<CODE SNIPPET>

Then, init tymix. You can configure some propeties:
<CODE SNIPPET>

Finally, when you want to describe a timestamp using tymix, do it simply like that:
<CODE SNIPPET>

Enjoy!
